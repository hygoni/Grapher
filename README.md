# Grapher
**Grapher** is Java Graph Library made by hygoni.

I made it because I had to write same codes because there's no public graph library on java.

the Grapher folder is an eclipse project. so you can simply import it.

**Currently Not Suitable For Solving Bipartite Matching Problems**:

it's because of poor time complexity of Ford-Fulkerson. I'll improved it soon

I'll add more functions on it!
